# PIDINST Metadata Schema
The Research Data Alliance Persistent Identification of Instruments Working Group ([PIDINST WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/persistent-identification-instruments-wg/)) seeks to explore a community-driven solution for globally unique identification of measuring instruments operated in the sciences.

The PIDINST WG produced [several outputs](https://docs.pidinst.org/en/latest/index.html). Among these is a [White Paper](https://docs.pidinst.org/en/latest/white-paper/index.html), which "provides recommendations for the use of instrument Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) for institutional instrument providers, such as bodies who fund, maintain or provide instruments, or are responsible for maintaining information about or data from instruments." 

As part of the PIDINST [White Paper](https://docs.pidinst.org/en/latest/white-paper/index.html), the WG proposed a [Metadata Schema](https://github.com/rdawg-pidinst/schema/blob/master/schema.rst) to be used for registering any type of scientific instrument at PID providers. The schema was designed to contain "enough information to unambiguously identify the instrument across networks and infrastructures."

The PIDINST WG provided an [XSD](https://github.com/rdawg-pidinst/schema/blob/master/support/pidinst-schema-1_0.xsd) and a [JSON-schema](https://github.com/rdawg-pidinst/schema/blob/master/support/pidinst-schema-1_0.schema.json) of the PIDINST Metadata Schema to be used as examples "that illustrate how the schema could be implemented [...]." but are not intended to be "authoritative."

This repository contains the serialization of the [PIDINST Metadata Schema](https://github.com/rdawg-pidinst/schema/blob/master/schema.rst), produced by the Imaging-PHD project in accordance with the PIDINST recommendations.
